#see all DB connectivity related .. all jwt related env variables [ these are variables that can also change based on the env you are working on ]
#Now we can use the settings.path or all the others as we need .. but see we dont have to expose these variables 
#on our code directly .. they are stored on a machine somewhere ... and with the path too 
# so professionally we can put all our environment  variables here .. like connectivity settings .. passwords like for the JWT database connectivity 


#SO IN PRODUCTION .. YOU WILL BE SETTING ALL THESE ON THE MACHINE ITSELF 
#IN A DEV ENVIRONMENT .. YOU CAN CREATE A .ENV FILE AND ASSIGN VALUES TO ALL THESE IN THERE and use that
